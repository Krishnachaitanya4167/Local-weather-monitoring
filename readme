1)To view the transmitted data from esp of arduino we need to use the mosquitto broker installed on server
2)for detailed installion procedure of arduino and its setup refer to repository->Arduino-esp communication



Installing mosquitto:
1)mosquitto is a broker that is used to publish and subscribe the messages using mqtt protocol.
2)It can installed in either windows or linux.but installing it in windows is a bit complicated process.
3)So,to install it in linux enter the following commands as mentioned below
-> Sudo su
->apt-get install mosquitto
->apt-get install mosquitto-clients
4)if any error of broken packages persists,goto software centre of ubuntu and delete the repositories
of mosquitto-ppa and try again the above commands.
Using mosquitto:
1)Mosquitto generally starts running as the system starts,to check whether it is running or not follow
as shown below
Open terminal->enter command: service status mosquitto
2)now to check whether the message is being transmitted and received or not
open two terminals

 In terminal-1 enter the command: mosquitto_sub -t “topic”
 In terminal-2enter the command :mosquitto_pub -t “topic” -m “message”
 You will see the output “message” on terminal1 then you can confirmm that mosquitto is
working.3)now open terminal 1 and use the command for subscription of the messages with the respective
outtopic
mosquitto_sub -t “output”
Here my outtopic is :”output”
4)now open terminal2 and use the command for publishing message with the intopic you specified at
your device.
Mosquitto_pub -t “input” -m “msg”
.
Here my intopic is:input and the message I want to transmit is “msg”
5)Generally ,if we publish a message from mqtt broker any device can receive the message with same
intopic and similarly in our subscription window we can recieve messages from any device that
specifies the outtopic as we mentioned inour subscription window.
NOTE:only if the server is the system where our broker runs I.e if the devices specify the server ip as
the system ip that we are using to run our mosquitto I.e mqtt broker.
6)we can redirect the output that we recieve in the subscription window into a text file by using
command:
mosquitto_sub -t “output”>log.txt
Here the output we see on subscription window will be stored in log.txt file.
